defmodule ThousandIsland do
  @moduledoc """
  Provides a high-level interface for starting and managing `ThousandIsland` server
  instances. Server instances exist as a process tree, which is usually started
  by starting this module's child spec within an existing supervision tree,
  or by calling `start_link/1` directly. 

  ## Examples

  A typical use of `ThousandIsland` might look like the following: 

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.Supervisor do
    # ... other Supervisor boilerplate

    def init(config) do
      children = [
        # ... other children as dictated by your app
        {ThousandIsland, port: 1234, handler_module: MyApp.ConnectionHandler}
      ]

      Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
    end
  end
  ```

  You can also start servers directly via the `start_link/1` function:

  ```elixir
  {:ok, pid} = ThousandIsland.start_link(port: 1234, handler_module: MyApp.ConnectionHandler)
  ```

  ## Configuration

  A number of options are defined when starting a server. The complete list is
  defined by the `t:options()` type.

  ## Logging & Telemetry

  As a low-level library, Thousand Island purposely does not do any inline 
  logging of any kind. The `ThousandIsland.Logging` module defines a number of
  functions to aid in tracing connections at various log levels, and such logging
  can be dynamically enabled and disabled against an already running server. This
  logging is backed by `:telemetry` events internally, and if desired these events
  can also be hooked by your application for logging or metric purposes. The following is a complete list of events emitted by Thousand Island:

  * `[:listener, :start]`: Emitted when the server first starts up. 
  * `[:transport, :listen, :start]`: Emitted when a transport module successfully listens on the configured port.
  * `[:acceptor, :start]`: Emitted when an acceptor process starts up.
  * `[:acceptor, :accept]`: Emitted when an acceptor process accepts a new client connection.
  * `[:acceptor, :shutdown]`: Emitted when an acceptor process shuts down.
  * `[:socket, :start]`: Emitted whenever a `ThousandIsland.Socket` handler process is created
  * `[:socket, :handshake, :complete]`: Emitted whenever a `ThousandIsland.Socket.handshake/1` call completes.
  * `[:socket, :handshake, :error]`: Emitted whenever a `ThousandIsland.Socket.handshake/1` call errors.
  * `[:socket, :recv, :complete]`: Emitted whenever a `ThousandIsland.Socket.recv/3` call completes.
  * `[:socket, :send, :complete]`: Emitted whenever a `ThousandIsland.Socket.send/2` call completes.
  * `[:socket, :sendfile, :complete]`: Emitted whenever a `ThousandIsland.Socket.sendfile/4` call completes.
  * `[:socket, :shutdown, :complete]`: Emitted whenever a `ThousandIsland.Socket.shutdown/2` call completes.
  * `[:socket, :close, :complete]`: Emitted wheneverr a `ThousandIsland.Socket.close/1` call completes.

  Where meaurements indicate a time duration they are are expressed in `System` 
  `:native` units for performance reasons. They can be conveted to any desired 
  time unit via `System.convert_time_unit/3`.
  """

  @typedoc """
  Possible options to configure a server. Valid option values are as follows:

  * `handler_module`: The name of the module used to handle connections to this server.
  The module is expected to implement the `ThousandIsland.Handler` behaviour. Required.
  * `handler_options`: A term which is passed as the second argument to all 
  `c:ThousandIsland.Handler.start_link/1` calls. Optional.
  * `port`: The TCP port number to listen on. If not specified this defaults to 4000.
  If a port number of `0` is given, the server will dynamically assign a port number
  which can then be obtained via `local_port/1`.
  * `transport_module`: The name of the module which provides basic socket functions.
  Thousand Island provides `ThousandIsland.Transports.TCP` and `ThousandIsland.Transports.SSL`,
  which provide clear and TLS encrypted TCP sockets respectively. If not specified this
  defaults to `ThousandIsland.Transports.TCP`.
  * `transport_options`: A keyword list of options to be passed to the transport module's
  `c:ThousandIsland.Transport.listen/2` function. Valid values depend on the transport
  module specified in `transport_module` and can be found in the documentation for the
  `ThousandIsland.Transports.TCP` and `ThousandIsland.Transports.SSL` modules. Any options
  in terms of interfaces to listen to / certificates and keys to use for SSL connections 
  will be passed in via this option.
  * `num_acceptors`: The numbner of acceptor processes to run. Defaults to 10.
