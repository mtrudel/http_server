defmodule ThousandIsland.Transports.TCP do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines a `ThousandIsland.Transport` implementation based on clear TCP sockets 
  as provided by Erlang's `:gen_tcp` module. For the most part, users of Thousand
  Island will only ever need to deal with this module via `transport_options`
  passed to `ThousandIsland` at startup time. A complete list of such options
  is defined via the `t::gen_tcp.listen_option()` type. This list can be somewhat 
  difficult to decipher; by far the most common value to pass to this transport 
  is the following:

  * `ip`:  The IP to listen on (defaults to all interfaces). IPs should be 
  described in tuple form (ie: `ip: {1, 2, 3, 4}`). The value `:loopback` can 
  be used to only bind to localhost. On platforms which support it (macOS and
  Linux at a minimum, likely others), you can also bind to a Unix domain socket 
  by specifying a value of `ip: {:local, "/path/to/socket"}`. Note that the port
  *must* be set to `0`, and that the socket is not removed from the filesystem
  after the server shuts down.

  Unless overridden, this module uses the following default options:

  ```elixir
  backlog: 1024,
  nodelay: true,
  linger: {true, 30},
  send_timeout: 30_000,
  send_timeout_close: true,
  reuseaddr: true
  ```

  The following options are required for the proper operation of Thousand Island
  and cannot be overridden at startup (though they can be set via calls to `setopts/2`)

  ```elixir
  mode: :binary,
  active: false
  ```
